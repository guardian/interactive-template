# grunt-init-interactive-template

> Create an interactive template project with [grunt-init] interactive-template

## Installation
If you haven't already done so, install [grunt-init](http://gruntjs.com/project-scaffolding).

Once grunt-init is installed, place this template in your `~/.grunt-init/`
directory. It's recommended that you use git to clone this template into that
directory, as follows:

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:guardian/interactive-template.git ~/.grunt-init/interactive-template
```

## Usage

At the command-line, cd into an empty directory, run this command and follow the prompts.

```bash
> grunt-init interactive-template 
```

_Note that this template will generate files in the current directory, so be 
sure to change to a new directory first if you don't want to overwrite existing 
files._
